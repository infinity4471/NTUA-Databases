## React Animation

Among the features which the KendoReact Animation component delivers are:

* [Types](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/animation/types/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-animation)&mdash;The Animation components animate their content by using various animation effects (Fade, Expand, Push, Reveal, Slide and Zoom).
* [Disabled animations](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/animation/disabled-state/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-animation)&mdash;The Animations allow you to enable or disable their showing or hiding effect.
* [Stacked animations](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/animation/stacked/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-animation)&mdash;All Animations extend the Animation component. However, the Push and Zoom Animations further extend Animation by using [the `stackChildren`](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/animation/api/PushProps/#toc-stackchildren/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-animation) options and enable you to stack animations.
* [Life-cycle hooks](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/animation/hooks/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-animation)&mdash;When you declaratively add or remove a child element, all Animations call specific hooks during the entering or exiting of the element.
* [Duration](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/animation/duration/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-animation)&mdash;All Animation types enable you to control the duration of the entering and exiting animation effects.
* [Direction](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/animation/direction/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-animation)&mdash;Except for the Fade Animation, the Animations provide a set of the predefined directions which allow you to control their entering and exiting effect
* [Exiting child components](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/animation/exiting-components/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-animation)&mdash;While an exiting child component is rendered because it still exists in the React Virtual DOM, it is no longer available in the DOM.
* [Theme support](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/styling/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-animation)&mdash;The KendoReact Animation, as well as all 80+ components in the KendoReact suite, are styled in three polished themes (Bootstrap, Material, and Default) and can be further customized to match your specific design guidelines.
